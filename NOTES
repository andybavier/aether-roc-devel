My notes so far:
* export HELM_VERSION=v3.2.4
* remove helm init from Makefile
* remove {{ tuple "hss" . | include "omec-control-plane.metadata_labels" | indent 8 }} from job.spec.template.metadata in job-hss-bootstrap.yaml and job-hss-db-sync.yaml
* run kubectl create namespace omec
* ServiceName needs to be added to StatefulSet.spec in oaisim (I made up the service names oaisim-ue and oaisim-enb.
Passed make test now. (edited)
